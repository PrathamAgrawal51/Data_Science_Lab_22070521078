## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Global Excess Deaths Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic** dataset from the World Health Organization (WHO). The project aims to clean, process, visualize, and derive insights from mortality data spanning 2020 and 2021. The analysis explores the pandemic's impact across different countries, demographics, and timeframes, culminating in a comprehensive report and a proposal for future machine learning modeling.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Robust script to handle missing values, standardize column names, and correct data types.
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Over 15 distinct visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: A world heatmap to visualize the global distribution of excess deaths.
- **Demographic Insights**: Detailed analysis of mortality impact based on age and sex.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Year-over-year comparisons and relational plots to understand the pandemic's evolution.
- **Detailed Reporting**: A full EDA report is included, summarizing all findings.
- **Model Implementation**: Several Machine Learning Models were implemented and the best models were intergrated into a dashboard.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard was made in order to visualize the dataset, compare between different geographical regions, view model results and predict future pandemic vulnerabilities.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced directly from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. It contains modeled estimates of excess deaths, providing a comprehensive view of the pandemic's direct and indirect mortality impact.

- **Source**: [WHO Data Sets](https://www.who.int/data/sets/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-modelled-estimates)
- **File**: `WHO_COVID_Excess_Deaths_Estimates_By_Countries.xlsx`
- **Rows**: 6,210 (raw), 6,208 (cleaned)
- **Columns**: 9

The analysis relies on the cleaned version of this dataset, `cleaned_who_excess_deaths.csv`, which is generated by the main Jupyter Notebook.

## 📈 Key Visualizations

This project generates a wide array of visualizations to explore the data, including:

1.  **Global Heatmap of Total Excess Deaths**
2.  Bar Charts of Deaths by Year, Sex, and Age Group
3.  Top & Bottom 15 Countries by Excess Deaths
4.  Box Plots and Violin Plots for Distribution Analysis
5.  Scatter Plots to show correlations
6.  Stacked Bar Charts for demographic composition
7.  A Correlation Matrix of numerical features

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PrathamAgrawal51/Pratham_Agrawal_22070521078_ML_CA1.git
    cd Pratham_Agrawal_22070521078_ML_CA1
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter openpyxl
    ```
    *Note: `openpyxl` is required for reading `.xlsx` files.*

### Running the Analysis

1.  Place the raw dataset `WHO_COVID_Excess_Deaths_Estimates_By_Countries.xlsx` in the root directory of the project.

2.  Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  Open the `Pratham_Agrawal_ML_CA1.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will perform all data cleaning, generate all visualizations, and save the cleaned dataset.
